Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used.

1. Using git push --force (Risky)
If you rewrite history and force push, it will overwrite everything, even if someone else has pushed new commits.

Example: Using --force
Step 1: Initial Commits
Assume we have this commit history on main:

css
Copy
Edit
A - B - C (origin/main)
You decide to revert back to commit B and push:

sh
Copy
Edit
git reset --hard B
git push origin main --force
What Happens?
Commit C is deleted from the remote repository.

If another developer had pushed a new commit D, it gets lost!

2. Using git push --force-with-lease (Safer)
This option checks if the remote branch is the same as your last known state before overwriting.

Example: Using --force-with-lease
Step 1: Initial Commits
css
Copy
Edit
A - B - C (origin/main)
Step 2: You Modify History
You reset the last commit:

sh
Copy
Edit
git reset --hard B
git push origin main --force-with-lease
What Happens?
If nobody else has updated the branch, your changes are applied.

If someone else has pushed commits (e.g., D), Git rejects your push:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
error: failed to push some refs to 'origin'
This prevents accidental overwriting of commits!

When to Use --force-with-lease?
Use it when you want to rewrite history but only if the remote branch is unchanged.
Don't use --force unless you're sure no one else has pushed changes.

Final Thoughts
--force is dangerous (only use it when working alone or fixing errors).

--force-with-lease is safe (prevents overwriting othersâ€™ work).

Would you like a real-world scenario where this is critical?

Q6. How to un-stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.

1. Unstage a Specific File
If you staged a file using git add file.txt but want to unstage it:

sh
Copy
Edit
git reset file.txt
The file will remain unchanged, but it moves from the staged area back to the working directory.

2. Unstage All Staged Files
If you added multiple files and want to unstage everything, use:

sh
Copy
Edit
git reset
This removes all staged changes but keeps the actual file modifications.

3. Unstage and Discard All Changes
If you want to remove both staged and unstaged changes (irreversible action):

sh
Copy
Edit
git reset --hard
This resets your working directory to the last committed state.

4. Unstage the Last Commit (But Keep Changes)
If you already committed but want to undo the commit while keeping the changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
git reset --soft HEAD~1
This moves the changes back to the staged area.
